### A boss agent worth your while ðŸ¦¾ðŸ’°


## Setup 

First make sure `ollama` is installed and able to serve required models:
```commandline
./setup.sh
```

(Tested with Python 3.12.7.
For best results, make sure your `python3` has this version.
You can use [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for local `python` versioning if needed.)



Create + activate Python env:

```commandline
python3 -m venv ~/envs/bosworth
source ~/envs/bosworth/bin/activate
```

- TODO: Combine python evn setup into `setup.sh`
- TODO: Set up packages via `uv`

Start app in a shell:
```commandline
PYTHONPATH=. python bosworth/app/main.py
```


```commandline
> curl localhost:8000/chat -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"query": "hello"}' && echo

{"content":"Hello! It's great to meet you! I'm Bosworth, your friendly finance AI agent.
